# E-Commerce-Back-End

## App Description

This app serves to be the backend for a test website. It allows the user to learn how to connect routes and models together and test different ways to pass data around

## Motivation Behind the project/why I built it

My motivation behind this project was to better my ability with working with sql and backend code.

## Problems I came across during development

One of my biggest problems on this project really could've happened on any other project, and it was a simple naming difference between my routes and what I was inserting into insomnia.

## What I learned from this project

I really increased my knowledge and ability with backend code

## App usage

To use this app simply clone this repo, then find the .env.EXAMPLE file, copy and paste it, and change one of the two versions to be titled .env . After changing the title, on the file titled .env fill in the blanks with your information and save the file. Next open the console/git bash and go to this file directory and perform an npm i, this will install all of the needed files to continue. After performing an npm i, open up mysql workbench and sign in. Once you've logged in, come back to VS Code and copy all the code on the file titled "schema.sql" and paste that on a file in your workbench and run it. Next what you'll need to do is go back to the console/git bash window and type in "npm run seed". This will seed the database and make is usable. Afterwards, type in "npm run start", this will make the server live and will allow you to interact with it through insomnia. The final step will be to open up insomnia and type in http://localhost:3001/api/... followed by what you'd like to view.
